# EchoMi AI Delivery Assistant - Testing Guide

## üß™ Complete Testing Without Backend Dependencies

Your application is now ready for testing the complete delivery person flow!

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install flask flask-cors pydantic python-dotenv
```

2. **Start the application:**
```bash
python main.py
```

3. **Application will start at:** `http://localhost:5000`

## üìû Testing the Enhanced Delivery Person Flow

### Scenario 1: Delivery Person Requests OTP + Gets Customer Address

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/conversation/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Hi, I am here for Swiggy delivery. Can I get the OTP?",
    "caller_type": "delivery_person",
    "firebase_uid": "test_user_123",
    "caller_id": "+91 98765 43210"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
- AI detects: Delivery person requesting OTP
- System finds Swiggy order in mock database
- Returns OTP (1234) formatted for speech: "1 2 3 4"
- **NEW:** Provides customer's delivery address
- **NEW:** Suggests navigation help if current location is provided

### Scenario 2: Complete Navigation Flow (Current Location ‚Üí Customer Address)

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/conversation/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "I am currently at Cubbon Park. Need directions to apartment 3B, Brigade Towers, Brigade Road",
    "caller_type": "delivery_person",
    "session_id": "nav_session_001"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
- AI detects: Navigation request with current location
- Extracts current location: "Cubbon Park"

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "I am at Bangalore Railway Station, how to reach the delivery address?",
    "caller_type": "delivery_person"
  }'

# Test 2: "Currently at" format  
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/conversation/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Currently at Forum Mall, need directions to customer",
    "caller_type": "delivery_person"
  }'

# Test 3: "Near" format
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/conversation/process \
